## SUPERSTITIONS

- never sleep under a tree on the new moon or you’ll dream of the underworld
    
- if you shear a sheep under the stars, it will never grow thick wool again
    
- sheep with mismatched eyes can see the spirits and guide the herd away from danger
    

- Professor Reality used to be that one
    

  

## CIRCUS ACTS

- murakh trains mongooses to form a ring and we shoot twigby out of a cannon through the ring of mongooses
    

- mongooses wave and clap and do other cool and fun stuff
    

  

## FACTS

- murakh carries around a small, carved wooden sheep as a memento of his lost herd. he talks to it sometimes as if it’s part of the flock, seeking guidance from the little figure whenever he feels particularly lost or unsure of where to go next
