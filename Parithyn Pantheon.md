## Summary

The old [[Parithya|Parithyn]] gods rule over [[Veril]]. They are divided into two pantheons: that of [[Vrakis]], and that of [[Feyla]]. After the [[Fall of Parithya]], they were severely weakened, no longer taking part in mortal battles, but still watching from afar and playing favorites.

*Note: there isn't a set number of gods for each pantheon, but each god should have a corresponding god in the other pantheon. They should also be on a scale from lawful to chaotic.*
