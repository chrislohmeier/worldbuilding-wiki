Blaithin is an evil lich residing in the [[Lichen Lair]]. During the invasion of [[Dortesya]] by the [[Callestian Empire]], her spirit was dissolved into seven component parts (see [[Lichen Lair]]). 

### Life
Blaithin was the first baby born in [[Shane's Hollow]], after the Wood Elves left [[Callestia]] for a new home. Her mother, who arrived without a partner or spouse, grew very sick upon landing, and died during childbirth.
