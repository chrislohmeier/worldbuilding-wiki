## Summary

Blaithin is an evil lich residing in the [[Lichen Lair]]. During the invasion of [[Dortesya]] by the [[Callestian Empire]], her spirit was dissolved into seven component parts (see [[Lichen Lair]]). 

### Life

Blaithin was the first baby born in [[Shane's Hollow]] after the Wood Elves left [[Callestia]] for a new home. Her mother, who arrived without a partner or spouse, grew very sick upon landing after a snake bit her, and died during childbirth. She grew up as an orphan in town, where she was relatively isolated, except for [[Shane II]], who became her best friend and later, lover. 

Blaithin was taught by [[Alonso the Wizard]] before turning against him after finding out that he guarded the festering magic of a dead [[Grython]]. With access to this magical energy, she was able to unlock the secret of immortality, at a great cost to herself. In order to "live" forever, she had to die, which she did by capturing a snake and letting it bite her.

## Death

Immortality caused Blaithin to go insane. Over the span of decades, her heart split into seven component parts.

1. Jealousy (main): Jealousy is the main heart of the lich, representing her feelings towards the original Shane who founded Shane's Hollow. It takes Blaithin’s original form. Upon approach, each player will make a Charisma check. The player with the lowest will be asked by Blaithin, “Shane? Shane, is that you? Who are you with? Why did you leave me?” That player will see a vision of Blaithin in the past through Shane’s eyes, saying those words. Shane runs away and is killed by the monster in the beastiary.
2. Anger (flame skull): Anger is the manifestation of explosive unpredictability of a fragile ego. Script: “YOU THINK I’M WEAK, DON’T YOU? YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TRUE POWER IS”
3. Intelligence (Hooters):
4. Prejudice: Banshee guarding a jar with a reward, party must trick the banshee. In the jar is Dust of Disappearance. Upon taking the jar, the room fills with a mist. Party must make DC 14 WIS saving throw each round. Upon fail, roll to see who they attack for 1 turn.
5. Greed: Greed manifests as a beggar in the dungeon, who is actually a wraith. The wraith takes in magical items or coins - starts out with 1 hp, but for every gp given, the wraith will gain 1 hp. Close inspection will reveal gold rings on hands, looting the body will reveal 100 gp worth of jewelry. 
6. Narcissism (a magic mirror): Players must make a Wisdom saving throw to pick up the mirror, which is hand held. Otherwise, they become paralyzed, and each turn they must attempt to get closer to the mirror. Upon touching the mirror, the player makes a CON saving throw or is turned into stone for 1d12 hours.
7. Honor: Animated armor that wants players to repent/atone for bad things they’ve done. Players must make a DC 18 INT saving throw as they try to evade the probing psychic energy of the armor. If they fail, they are flooded with thoughts of the worst thing they've ever done, and to avoid taking 2d8 psychic damage and the armor becoming hostile, every player has 1 minute to take an action to repent for what they've done. Players can talk and lie if they pass a high DC Deception check. Honor is wielding a +2 magical greataxe.
