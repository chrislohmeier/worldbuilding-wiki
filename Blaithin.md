Blaithin is an evil lich residing in the [[Lichen Lair]]. During the invasion of [[Dortesya]] by the [[Callestian Empire]], her spirit was dissolved into seven component parts (see [[Lichen Lair]]). 

### Life
Blaithin was the first baby born in [[Shane's Hollow]], after the Wood Elves left [[Callestia]] for a new home. Her mother, who arrived without a partner or spouse, grew very sick upon landing after a snake bit her, and died during childbirth. She grew up as an orphan in town, where she was relatively isolated.

Blaithin was taught by [[Alonso the Wizard]] before turning against him after finding out that he guarded the festering magic of a dead [[Grython]]. With access to this magical energy, she was able to unlock the secret of immortality, at a great cost to herself.
