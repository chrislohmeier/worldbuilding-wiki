## Summary

Neutral is a dog that has spent years on the trail of whatever killed the sheep he herded. He was the sheep herding dog of [[Murakh of the Steppe]]. 

## Sheep murder

Neutral wasn't great at herding sheep, and even less good at protecting them, so when he heard his sheep baa-ing in a terrified manner, he promptly fled into a small hollow, and didn't see what happened next. What he *smelled*, however, would send him on a search to the very ends of [[Veril]]. 

After years of searching, Neutral has concluded that the most likely explanation was the Murakh's sheep were killed by a [[Grython]].
