## Summary

The Callestian Empire is the major political power of [[Callestia]] and the lands that surround it. Its capitol is [[Gladiolus]]. 

## Culture

Denizens of the Empire have developed a highly commercialized, materialistic culture revolving around [[Aurite]]. Magic is highly revered in this society, although a number of different perspectives have developed surrounding the proper use of magic, ranging from the [[Earthbound]], who shun the use of magic by humans, deeming it as "unnatural," to wizards among the landed elite who look down upon non-magic users.
