## Summary

The Fall of Parithya happened suddenly several thousand years ago, when [[Parithya]] disappeared from [[Veril]]. Its true causes are unknown, but many theorize that the [[Grython|Grythoi]] had something to do with it. 

What is known is that the Grythoi first overthrew their Parithyn masters, and then turned their ire towards the old [[Parithyn Pantheon]]. This left the gods severely weakened, but left no trace of the Grythoi.
