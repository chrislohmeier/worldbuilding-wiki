## Summary

The Shade Dwarves are the inhabitants of the [[Shaded Highlands]], and are the rulers of [[Ferontown]]. They tend to stick to their own kind, but dislike Gnomes in particular. 

## History

The Shaded Highlands was ruled by dragons who enslaved the Shade Dwarves for hundreds of years. This ended during the [[Shrouded War]]. Little is known of the early history of the dwarves or where they came from.

## Temperament

Shade dwarves are famously feisty. They consider mirth to be a flaw, and consider insults to be the greatest form of truth-telling. They reserve positivity and compliments for their greatest enemies. At first, this developed because the dwarves needed to covertly signal to their allies that they were on their side, but after the dragons were driven out, the Shade Dwarves saw no reason to change.
