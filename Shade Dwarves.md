## Summary

The Shade Dwarves are the inhabitants of the [[Shaded Highlands]], and are the rulers of [[Ferontown]]. They tend to stick to their own kind, but dislike Gnomes in particular.

## Temperament

Shade dwarves are famously feisty. They consider mirth to be a flaw, and consider insults to be the greatest form of truth-telling. They reserve positivity and compliments for their greatest enemies.
