## Summary

The Society of Sentient Squirrels is a society of highly intelligent and sophisticated squirrels all over [[Arvendor]]. Overall, the Society prides itself in being a noble force for good. However, squirrels never forget being wronged, and can hold grudges for generations. Many of these squirrels can wild-shape into humanoids, which they often do to interact with humanoid societies.

Squirrels can become sentient by absorbing the energies from a [[Grythfall]].
