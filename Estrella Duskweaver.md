## Summary
Estrella is an adventurer who associates with the circus in game. Unbeknownst to her, her mom didn't see a beholder when she was pregnant, she saw a [[Grython]].

## Alexa's backstory
Deemed as “cursed” due to her birth defect of being born with extra eyes due to high magic exposure, was left on the anti magic island and raised under the guidance of the church there and abused for her additional features. Found solace in being outside amidst the stars which is how she drew the attention of the celestial god who aided her in killing several members of the church so she could escape.

From texts: She’s a manic cleric/priestess for a celestial god and believe that it’s her task to save everyone through divine intervention Through whatever this campaign’s world’s star signs will be lol She’s also more than happy to get rid of any “non-believers” and one of the things about this campaign is that everyone is a part of a traveling circus troupe, and she’s involved in it because she wants to convert someone in it and it’s convenient to her goals, also people keep going missing wherever they go For her background, it turns out that she’s not just killing “non-believers” but rather members of this anti-magic church from a “non-magic-island” where practitioners of magic are killed or punished, so her parents and ancestors would have never been exposed to it until her mother would have encountered a “high magic” creature and so she’d have been affected in the womb (cause I was thinking how cool it would be for things that hadn’t experienced magic before to have no tolerance to it and have their genes affected by it) thus the four eyes and ability to detect magic traces, but she’d have been given up for this to the church where she’d have been tormented for being “an abomination” until she’d have been chosen by this celestial god who’d have helped her kill members of the church to escape. She targets the people from the anti-magic church who she deems won’t change their ways, I was thinking one way she could figure them out is by inviting them to have their fortunes read while the circus would be visiting and gauging their reactions or something along those lines. The beholder is actually the creature her mother would have encountered while pregnant with her (thus the additional eyes and weird magic sensing lol)
