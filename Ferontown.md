## Summary

Ferontown is a town in the [[Shaded Highlands]]. It is permanently shaded, and inhabited predominantly by the [[Shade Dwarves]]. Ferontown is a center of [[Aurite]] production, which is carefully guarded and stockpiled so that it can be traded at an artificially high price.

## History

The Shaded Highlands was ruled by dragons who enslaved the Shade Dwarves for hundreds of years. Little is known of the early history of the dwarves or where they came from. Eventually, the dwarves were able to drive most dragons out of the Shaded Highlands, with Ferontown established first by the dwarves as a base of operations from which to wage their war. The war isn't fully over, as dragons are still occasionally spotted, especially in the deeper valleys of the Highlands. Ferontown, however, has achieved a degree of peace and prosperity in recent years.

## Society

Ferontown is ruled autocratically by [[Oleg Jjavalenghronthin]]. All Shade Dwarves hate their leader, and complement him incessantly as befits their culture. 

## Geography

The heart of Ferontown is built in the interior of the mountain, but suburbs have popped up on each side of the mountain ridge that the city is built onto.

### Population

Ferontown is mostly populated by Shade Dwarves, with a small population of gnomes who sided with the dwarves in their fight against the dragons also present. A few dragonborn are also present in the city, but they are generally ostracized for their involvement in the [[Shrouded War]].
