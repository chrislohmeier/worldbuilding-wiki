## Summary

Oleg Jjavalenghronthin (known as and henceforth referred to as King Oleg) is the king of the [[Shade Dwarves]]. He relies entirely on [[Aurite]] for his powers, ordering a suit of Aurite armor to be made to protect him at all times. Oleg thinks that his populace is convinced that he is a god-king, and often gives "shows" of his power, fueled by Aurite.
