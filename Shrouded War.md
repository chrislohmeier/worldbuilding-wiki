## Summary

The Shrouded War occurred when the [[Shade Dwarves]] and a small number of Gnomes revolted against their Draconic rulers and cast their chains away, creating an independent society. During this time, the dragonborn serving their draconic masters continued to serve. However, many of these dragonborn set off on their own when their masters were killed.
