## Summary
Quill Talkin was born into a community of Antiflockists, a sect of Kenku. Their belief, rooted in ancient Kenku folklore, aims to unravel the mystery behind their race's curse; the loss of their original voices and flight. The Antiflockists argue that by spreading across the land, learning, and delving into forgotten cultures and histories, Kenku may one day find the truth about their origins and break their curse.
Growing up, Quill struggled with the teachings of the Antiflockists. While others of his kind took solace in detachment, Quill longed for connection, especially with his son, whom he was forced to part with. The Antiflockist ideology forbids family bonds, insisting that personal attachments detract from the search for knowledge. Despite his love for his son, Quill has upheld this belief though it weighs heavily on his heart.
Quill's skills in magic developed early on. His hunger for knowledge led him down the path of wizardry. He became a collector of ancient tomes, forgotten spells, and enchanted artifacts. In his travels, Quill periodically joined traveling circuses, where he performed magical tricks and illusions. These excursions were primarily a means of travel.
Though he follows the Antiflockist faith out of a sense of duty and tradition, Quill secretly resents it. His heart yearns to break free from its rigid codes and reconnect with his son. He keeps this inner turmoil hidden, presenting himself as a loyal Antiflockist while privately questioning whether his people's search for the truth is worth the price of isolation.
Despite his emotional struggle, Quill is dedicated to his journey. He continues to wander, driven by the faint hope that discovering the truth about the Kenku curse will also help him resolve the conflict between his duty and his desires. Each relic he uncovers and each piece of history he collects,
