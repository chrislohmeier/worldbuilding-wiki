The Lichen Lair is an abandoned [[Parithya|Parithyn]] castle in [[Dortesya]]. It originally served as a [[Bestiary|bestiary]] and a fortress for the Parithyn kingdom, but later fell into ruin after the Parithynoi (the Parithyn people) disappeared thousands of years ago. Several centuries ago, it was used by the local wood elves of Dortesya to defend their land against a [[Callestian Empire|Callestian]] invasion, and was destroyed even further in the process. 

After it was sacked, the castle was taken over by the evil lich [[Blaithin]].

The lich's seven hearts reside in the lair:
1. Jealousy (main): 
    
2. Anger (flame skull): 
    
3. Intelligence (Hooters): 
    
4. Xeno/Neophobia (Banshee guarding a jar with a reward, party must trick the banshee):
    
5. Greed (a beggar in the dungeon, wraith): 
    
6. Narcissism (a magic mirror): 
    
7. Honor (animated armor that wants players to repent/atone for bad things theyâ€™ve done):
