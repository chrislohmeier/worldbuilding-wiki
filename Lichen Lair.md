 The Lichen Lair is a manor that is above an abandoned [[Parithya|Parithyn]] castle in [[Dortesya]]. It originally served as a [[Bestiary|bestiary]] and a fortress for the Parithyn kingdom, but later fell into ruin after the Parithynoi (the Parithyn people) disappeared thousands of years ago. Several centuries ago, it was used by the local wood elves of Dortesya to defend their land against a [[Callestian Empire|Callestian]] invasion, and was destroyed even further in the process. 

After it was sacked, the castle was taken over by the evil lich [[Blaithin]], who built a manor over the top of the ancient ruins. Still, underneath the manor is an evil [[Grython|Grythonic]] energy coming from the bestiary, which draws in those bitten by the snakes in the forest. 

Additionally, the manor is an outpost for the [[Society of Sentient Squirrels]], which is investigating the resurgence of [[Grython]]-related energies. 

The lich's seven hearts reside in the lair:
1. Jealousy (main): Jealousy is the largest heart of the lich, representing her feelings towards the original Shane who founded [[Shane's Hollow]]. 
    
2. Anger (flame skull): Anger is the manifestation of explosive unpredictability of a fragile ego.
    
3. Intelligence (Hooters): 
    
4. Prejudice: Banshee guarding a jar with a reward, party must trick the banshee. In the jar is Dust of Disappearance. Upon taking the jar, the room fills with a mist. Party must make DC 14 WIS saving throw each round. Upon fail, roll to see who they attack for 1 turn. 
    
5. Greed: Greed manifests as a beggar in the dungeon, who is actually a wraith. The wraith takes in magical items or coins.
    
6. Narcissism (a magic mirror): Players must make a Wisdom saving throw to pick up the mirror, which is hand held. Otherwise, they become paralyzed, and each turn they must attempt to get closer to the mirror. Upon touching the mirror, the player makes a CON saving throw or is turned into stone for 1d12 hours.
    
7. Honor: Animated armor that wants players to repent/atone for bad things they’ve done. Players must make a DC 18 INT saving throw as they try to evade the probing psychic energy of the armor. If they fail, they are flooded with thoughts of the worst thing they've ever done, and to avoid taking 2d8 psychic damage and the armor becoming hostile, every player has 1 minute to take an action to repent for what they've done. Players can talk and lie if they pass a high DC Deception check.

Each heart, when defeated, will turn into a tiny stone triangle, except for Jealousy, which drops the trinket that each triangle goes into.

### Loot

**Alchemy jug:**
**Dust of Disappearance:** renders all creatures within 10 feet invisible for 2d4 minutes when thrown. It is enough dust for 4 throws.
**Ghost Lantern:** A lantern that reveals invisible creatures within 30 feet while lit. Created to see the undead, this item glows with an eerie blue flame.
**Ferontown Key**: Found on top of a note that says, **FILL THIS OUT**
**Spell Scroll**: A single-use scroll containing one of the following: _Dispel Magic_, _Bestow Curse_, or _Counterspell_. Found in a locked desk drawer in Blaithin’s study.
**Heward's Handy Spice Pouch**: A pouch containing 10 charges of various spices. This small reward can add a surprising flavor to rations or a touch of warmth to the manor's dark feel.
**Spectral key**: A ghostly, translucent key that can open any mundane lock. Dissolves into mist after one use.
