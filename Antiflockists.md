## Summary

The Antiflockists are a sect of Kenku, distributed across the continents of [[Veril]]. They believe in spreading out, only meeting every so often for a grand [[Flocking]]. Notable Antiflockists include [[Quill Talkin]]. 

One of the goals of the Antiflockists is to lift the curse on the kenku and find their original notes.
