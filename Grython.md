## Summary
A Grython was a terrible, alien creature that the [[Parithya|Parithynoi]] kept in their [[Bestiary|Bestiaries]], until they disappeared from [[Veril]]. They resembled Beholders (and sometimes took the form of Beholders) but were entirely distinct.

On rare occasions, [[Grython|Grythoi]] took flight from their underground lairs, usually to go to battle. Dying while in the air caused a [[Grythfall]] above ground.

Grythons were created as librarians, designed to safeguard the knowledge that the Parithynoi gathered. They had no gods, although they venerated cats.
