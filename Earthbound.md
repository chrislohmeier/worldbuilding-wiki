## Summary

The Earthbound Order is a religious order that eschews any and all magic, believing it to be the source of evil in the world. Members of the Order stretch across the known continents of [[Veril]]. A prominent monastery is located on the island of [[Veil]]. The concept of being "Earthbound" refers to a state of being completely cleansed of magical influences. 

## History

Originally, the Earthbound developed from the [[Grython|Grythoi]] society of [[Alenkells]], in an attempt to control the humanoid populace who could use magic and fight back against their rule.
